## Daily Logs

### Day 1 - 02/26/2024
- Finished introduciton section, started first.
- downloaded numpy,python,pandas
- Learned introduction into KNN, Prediction
- #csv #python #metplatlib #numpy #pandas
- All codes maybe found at [https://github.com/zkalykov/harvardxcs109x/tree/main/file/Day1](https://github.com/zkalykov/harvardxcs109x/tree/main/file/Day1)

### Day 2 - 02/27/2024
- Introduction to Regression
- Worked with KNN
- Trained
- codes at [https://github.com/zkalykov/harvardxcs109x/tree/main/file/Day2](https://github.com/zkalykov/harvardxcs109x/tree/main/file/Day2)
  
### Day 3 - 02/28/2024
- Still exploring KNN regression
Summary: DataFrame and series and difference is 2d dimension and 1d dimension.
KNN algorithm in total gives us the value of nearest approriate value according K neighbours.
- knn in general finds the best predicted value.
- : It could be fonund as following:
- Lets say we have a tv budget with 150 and k=3 // which is k is better for smaller datta, we will go for all sales, and find distance, let's say we have 1....n data
- and we will find difference which is dif[0-n] and the knn result will be sum(dif[0] to dif[n-1])/k // we will delete to k
